            <h1>About The Amateur</h1>
            <p>
                The Amateur is a 2025 action thriller film starring Rami Malek, Rachel Brosnahan, and Jon Bernthal,
                directed by James Hawes. The film was released in the United States by 20th Century Studios on April
                11, 2025 and is based on Robert Littell's 1981 novel The Amateur.
                The story follows Charlie Heller (Rami Malek), a brilliant but introverted CIA cryptographer and
                decoder who takes matters into his own hands when his supervisors refuse to take action after his
                wife is killed in a London terrorist attack. The movie follows Charlie as he
                attempts to find the people who committed the terrorist attack that killed his wife.
                The film begins with Charlie restoring an old Cessna as a present from his wife, Sarah, who leaves
                for a business trip in London. When tragedy strikes and his wife
                becomes a victim of terrorism, Charlie's world is turned upside down. Frustrated by the CIA's
                inaction, this desk-bound decoder transforms from a basement office worker into someone seeking his
                own form of justice.
                The film received mixed reviews from critics, and this
                adaptation marks the second time the source material has been brought to screen - the original novel
                was previously adapted into a 1981 film starring John Savage and Christopher Plummer.
